Project Explanation — Online Banking System (Java Console App)
🔹 1. Introduction

This project is a Console-Based Online Banking System developed using Core Java (OOP).
It allows a user to create bank accounts, log in, check balance, deposit money, withdraw money, transfer funds between accounts, and close accounts.
All banking data is stored in Java collections (HashMap).

🔹 2. Project Objective

The main goal is to simulate real banking operations in a simple manner:

Create a secure user account

Authenticate using a password

Perform financial operations safely

Prevent invalid or dangerous transactions

🔹 3. System Architecture

The project uses three core components:

✔️ (A) UI / Controller Layer

Runs inside main() menu

Takes user input from console

Dispatches actions to Bank

✔️ (B) Business Logic Layer — Bank Class

Manages accounts

Validates input

Executes operations (deposit, withdraw, transfer)

Stores accounts using a HashMap

✔️ (C) Data Layer — Account Class

Stores account details

Encapsulates balance

Protects password

Offers functions to change account state

🔹 4. Core Features & Implementation
⭐ 1. Account Creation

User enters name + password

System generates unique account ID

Stored in HashMap

⭐ 2. User Authentication

When logging in, password is compared

Only valid accounts are allowed

⭐ 3. Balance Inquiry

The account shows current balance

⭐ 4. Deposit

Adds amount to account balance

Blocks negative values

⭐ 5. Withdraw

Deducts money only if balance is enough

Exceptions prevent overdrafts

⭐ 6. Transfer

Withdraws from sender → deposits to receiver

Validates both accounts

⭐ 7. Close Account

Only possible if balance = 0

Prevents accidental loss

🔹 5. Data Structures Used
✔️ HashMap
private HashMap<Integer, Account> accounts;


Used to store:

Account ID → Account object

Fast lookup: O(1)

🔹 6. Object-Oriented Concepts Used
🔵 Encapsulation

All account details (balance, password) are private.

🔵 Abstraction

User interacts with menu → doesn’t see internal logic.

🔵 Polymorphism (if IAccount interface used)

Different account behaviors implement the same methods.

🔵 Classes & Objects

Each user = Account object

🔹 7. Input Validation

The program checks:

Empty name

Minimum password length

Numeric input for IDs

Non-negative deposit/withdraw

Sufficient balance

Account existence before operations

This prevents runtime crashes and invalid state.

🔹 8. Error Handling

Uses try–catch blocks and logical checks:

Wrong password

Insufficient balance

Invalid account number

Ensures smooth and safe execution.

🔹 9. Why This Project Is Important

This project teaches essential concepts:

Real-world simulations

Banking logic

Object-oriented programming

Data validation

CRUD operations on objects

Console interaction

Separation of UI and logic

🔹 10. Future Enhancements

To make it production-ready:

MySQL database integration

Password hashing using SHA-256

GUI (JavaFX / Swing)

Transaction history

Role-based users (admin, customer)

Online banking REST API
