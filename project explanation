Project Explanation: Online Banking System
1. Overview

The Online Banking System is a console-based banking application implemented in Java. It demonstrates key Java concepts like OOP (Inheritance, Polymorphism, Interfaces), Collections, JDBC database connectivity, multithreading, and data validation. The system allows users to create accounts, deposit and withdraw money, and perform basic account management, while persisting account data in a MySQL database.

The project is designed for educational purposes, simulating real-world banking operations in a simplified manner.

2. Core Features

Account Management

Users can create accounts with:

Account Holder Name (e.g., "Ashutosh Kumar")

Account ID (e.g., 1001)

Password (min 4 characters)

Initial Deposit (>= 0)

Account information is stored both in memory and in a MySQL database.

Login & Authentication

Users log in with Account ID and Password.

The system verifies credentials before allowing transactions.

Banking Operations

Balance Inquiry: Check current account balance.

Deposit: Add funds to the account.

Withdraw: Remove funds, respecting account rules:

SavingsAccount: Cannot withdraw more than balance.

CurrentAccount: Allows overdraft up to a limit (e.g., 1000).

Multithreading Demo: Perform concurrent deposits and withdrawals safely using synchronized blocks.

Account Listing

Displays all accounts stored in memory.

Useful for debugging or admin operations.

3. Technical Implementation
3.1 Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

Interface (IAccount) defines essential account methods.

Abstract Class (Account) implements common functionality:

deposit(), getBalance(), checkPassword().

Child Classes (SavingsAccount, CurrentAccount) implement polymorphic withdraw() behavior.

Exception Handling: Ensures invalid operations (like overdrafts or negative deposits) are properly handled.

3.2 Collections & Generics

HashMap<Integer, IAccount> accountMap stores accounts in memory.

Supports fast lookup by Account ID.

Demonstrates use of Java Generics (Map<Integer, IAccount>).

3.3 Multithreading & Synchronization

TransactionThread class allows concurrent deposit/withdraw operations.

Uses synchronized keyword to prevent race conditions on account balances.

3.4 Database Connectivity (JDBC)

DBConnection class: Provides connection to MySQL bank_db.

AccountDAO class: Handles CRUD operations:

saveAccount(), getAccount(), updateBalance(), getAllAccounts().

Ensures persistence: account data survives program restarts.

3.5 Data Validation

Name: Cannot be empty.

Password: Minimum 4 characters.

Deposit / Withdraw: Must be positive, and withdraw must not exceed allowed balance.

Account ID: Must exist in memory/database for login and transactions.

4. Database Design

Database: bank_db

Table: accounts

Columns:

id (INT, PRIMARY KEY) → e.g., 1001

name (VARCHAR) → e.g., "Ashutosh Kumar"

password (VARCHAR) → user password

balance (DOUBLE) → current account balance

5. Example Workflow

Create Account

Name: Ashutosh Kumar

Password: 1234

Initial Deposit: 5000

Account ID generated: 1001

Login

Enter Account ID: 1001

Enter Password: 1234

Check Balance

Output: 5000

Deposit / Withdraw

Deposit 200 → Balance: 5200

Withdraw 300 → Balance: 4900

Multithreaded Transactions

Deposit 200 and Withdraw 150 concurrently → Balance updates safely

Exit

Account balance updated in database automatically.
