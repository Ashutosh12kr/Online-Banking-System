Online Banking System Project Explanation
1. Project Overview

The Online Banking System is a Java-based desktop application with GUI, supporting basic banking operations such as account creation, login, deposit, and withdrawal. The system uses JDBC for database connectivity and multithreading for concurrent transactions. The project demonstrates object-oriented programming (OOP), collections, generics, exception handling, and event-driven GUI programming.

2. Core Features
A. Account Management

Create Savings Accounts with unique account IDs.

Store account details in MySQL database.

Supports password-protected login.

Retrieve account information (balance, account holder name, account ID).

B. Transactions

Deposit money into account.

Withdraw money from account with validation for insufficient balance.

Transactions are thread-safe, ensuring synchronized deposit/withdraw operations using multithreading.

C. Database Connectivity

JDBC is used to connect to MySQL (bank_db) database.

Account information is persisted in the accounts table.

CRUD operations implemented through DAO pattern (AccountDAO class).

D. GUI Implementation

Java Swing GUI for user-friendly interface.

Forms for account creation, login, deposit, and withdrawal.

Output display area shows transaction success or error messages.

Event handling ensures real-time updates and interaction.

E. Core OOP Concepts

Interface (IAccount)

Defines core methods for bank accounts: deposit(), withdraw(), getBalance(), getAccountId(), getName().

Abstract Class (Account)

Implements common behavior of all accounts.

Stores account ID, name, password, and balance.

Provides synchronized deposit method.

Polymorphism

SavingsAccount implements abstract behavior and overrides withdraw().

F. Collections and Generics

Map<Integer, IAccount> stores in-memory account objects for fast lookup.

List<IAccount> used to retrieve all accounts from the database.

G. Multithreading

Transactions (deposit/withdraw) are handled by separate threads (TransactionThread) to simulate real-world concurrent banking operations.

Synchronization ensures data consistency.

H. Exception Handling

Deposit and withdrawal methods validate amounts.

Throws exceptions for:

Negative or zero deposits/withdrawals.

Insufficient funds.

GUI displays user-friendly error messages.

3. Innovation / Extra Effort

Threaded transactions simulate real banking concurrency.

GUI interface for easy interaction instead of command-line only.

Data validation ensures robust and secure transactions.

4. Technology Stack

Java (JDK 11+)

Swing for GUI

MySQL database for storage

JDBC for database connectivity

Multithreading and Collections Framework

5. Database Schema

Table: accounts

Column	Type	Description
id	INT	Unique Account ID
name	VARCHAR(50)	Account holder name
password	VARCHAR(50)	Password for login
balance	DOUBLE	Current account balance
6. Project Flow

User launches the GUI application.

User can:

Create an account → Generates ID and stores in database.

Login → Authenticates using account ID and password.

Deposit → Amount added to balance using thread-safe method.

Withdraw → Amount deducted after validation.

All changes are updated in the database.

GUI displays transaction results in real-time.

7. Key Learning Outcomes

Mastered OOP concepts: abstraction, inheritance, polymorphism, interfaces.

Learned database connectivity with JDBC.

Implemented multithreaded operations for concurrent banking.

Built event-driven GUI applications.

Applied collections and generics for data management.

Handled exceptions and validations for robust software.
