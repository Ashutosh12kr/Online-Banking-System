Event Handling & Processing in OnlineBankingSystem
1. What is Event Handling?

In software, event handling is the process of responding to user actions such as clicking a button, entering input, or selecting a menu option.

In a console application, these “events” are triggered by user input (via Scanner) and processed through switch-case statements or method calls.

2. Events in this Code
a) Main Menu Events

User selects options in the main menu:

System.out.println("\n1. Create Account");
System.out.println("2. Login");
System.out.println("3. List Accounts");
System.out.println("4. Exit");
int ch = sc.nextInt(); sc.nextLine();


Each selection triggers a different event handler method:

1 -> createAccount()

2 -> login()

3 -> listAccounts()

4 -> System.exit(0)

Explanation: The switch (ch) statement acts as an event dispatcher, invoking the appropriate function when the user enters a choice.

b) Account Menu Events

After login, the user sees the account menu:

System.out.println("\n1. Balance");
System.out.println("2. Deposit");
System.out.println("3. Withdraw");
System.out.println("4. Demo Multithread");
System.out.println("5. Exit");


Each menu selection triggers a method call:

1 -> show balance

2 -> doDeposit(acc)

3 -> doWithdraw(acc)

4 -> doThreads(acc)

5 -> exit and update DB

This is event-driven programming in a console context. The “events” are user choices, and the handlers are the respective methods.

c) Multithreaded Transactions

The Demo Multithread option triggers two concurrent threads:

Thread t1 = new TransactionThread(acc, 200, true);  // deposit
Thread t2 = new TransactionThread(acc, 150, false); // withdraw
t1.start();
t2.start();


Event: Thread execution

Event handler: run() method of TransactionThread class processes the deposit/withdraw operations safely using synchronized.

This shows concurrent event processing, ensuring balance consistency.

3. Input Validation as Event Filtering

All user inputs are validated before processing:

if (amt <= 0) throw new Exception("Amount must be > 0");


Invalid inputs trigger an error event, which is caught by exception handling, preventing crashes.
