🔹 Interface (Core Java)
1️⃣ What is an Interface?

An interface in Java is a blueprint of a class that contains abstract methods (methods without body).
It is used to achieve 100% abstraction and to define what a class must do, not how it does it.

2️⃣ Why Interface is Used in This Project?

In the Online Banking System, an interface is used to:

Define common banking operations

Support multiple account types

Achieve loose coupling

Enable polymorphism

3️⃣ Interface Used in Project
📌 IAccount Interface
interface IAccount {
    void deposit(double amt);
    void withdraw(double amt) throws Exception;
    double getBalance();
    int getAccountId();
    String getName();
}

4️⃣ Explanation of Methods
Method	Purpose
deposit()	Adds amount to account
withdraw()	Removes amount from account
getBalance()	Returns current balance
getAccountId()	Returns account ID
getName()	Returns account holder name
5️⃣ Implementation of Interface
📌 Abstract Class Implementing Interface
abstract class Account implements IAccount {
    protected int id;
    protected String name;
    protected String password;
    protected double balance;
}


✔ Interface methods are implemented in:

Account (partially)

SavingsAccount (fully)

6️⃣ Polymorphism Using Interface
IAccount acc = new SavingsAccount(101, "Ashu", "1234", 5000);


✔ Allows:

Same reference for different account types

Easy future extension (CurrentAccount, LoanAccount)

7️⃣ Interface in DAO & Collections
Map<Integer, IAccount> cache = new HashMap<>();


✔ Ensures:

Generic handling of accounts

Flexibility

Clean design

8️⃣ Advantages of Using Interface

✔ Achieves abstraction
✔ Supports multiple inheritance
✔ Improves security
✔ Increases flexibility
✔ Makes code scalable

9️⃣ Difference: Interface vs Abstract Class
Interface	Abstract Class
100% abstraction	Partial abstraction
No constructor	Can have constructor
Methods abstract	Abstract + concrete
Multiple inheritance	Single inheritance
