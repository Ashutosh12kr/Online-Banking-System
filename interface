1. Interface: IAccount

In your code, the interface defines core behaviors for any type of bank account (Savings or Current). It allows polymorphism so that methods can operate on any account type without knowing the exact class.

interface IAccount {
    void deposit(double amt);           // Deposit money into account
    void withdraw(double amt) throws Exception; // Withdraw money, may throw exception
    double getBalance();                // Get current balance
    int getAccountId();                 // Get unique account ID
    String getName();                   // Get account holder name
}

Explanation of Interface Methods
Method	Purpose in Code
deposit(double amt)	Adds money to the account. Used in doDeposit() and TransactionThread.
withdraw(double amt)	Withdraws money, validating balance and overdraft limits. Used in doWithdraw() and multithreaded transactions.
getBalance()	Returns current balance. Used in account menu and transaction display.
getAccountId()	Returns account ID. Used in login, account listing, and database operations.
getName()	Returns holder name. Used in account menu, listing, and display.
Key Points

Polymorphism:
Both SavingsAccount and CurrentAccount implement IAccount. Methods like deposit() and withdraw() can be called on any account type.

Thread Safety:
Methods deposit() and withdraw() are synchronized in the implementing classes to prevent race conditions in multithreading.

Exception Handling:
withdraw() can throw exceptions for invalid amount or insufficient balance, allowing robust error handling.

Decoupling:
The interface allows the OnlineBankingSystem code and DAO to work with IAccount objects without knowing the exact class type, making it easier to extend with new account types.
